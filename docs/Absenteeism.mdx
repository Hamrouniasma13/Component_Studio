## Type: `molecule`

# Absenteeism

This component should be used with the `Slice` component, to be fully functionnal.

The color should be registered in `theme.colors`, and is display as the image background. It's defaulted to `transparent` if you don't provide one, or the color you provide is not in the theme colors.

The image is maxed to `330*300`, and centered on the right panel. It's not display on mobile, and the right panel is displayed even if you don't provide an image.
The right panel takes the height of the left panel, so the more items you push, the higher this component will looks.

_PS: This component does not react well if you give too long label, so try to avoid that case._

_PPS: it's called **Absenteeism** because it was it's original function, but you can use it for any other type of data, as long it feets your need_
