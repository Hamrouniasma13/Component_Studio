# Square Button

This button is mostly used in action banner.

The icon is optionnal, and must come from [the icon list](/icon)

The label is also optionnal, but it's better to use one.

On every media, it's always 120\*120.

Every other props than _children_ and _icon_ are passed to the dom element, which is a [Link](/link)
