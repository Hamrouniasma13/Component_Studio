# Component Studio 1.1.1

Welcome to Digital Studio's components library.
As a developer, a designer, or a CMS contributor, you can found here the components that you'll use to build your website.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i component-studio
```

## Get started

Import the component-studio

```javascript
import {
  ThemeProvider,
  Container,
  Header,
  Footer,
  Text,
  ActionBanner,
  Slice,
  Button,
} from 'component-studio'
```

In order to make our components looks nicely, we have few stuff to add first:

- Use the `<ThemeProvider />` by wrapping all your pages inside.
- Add a `<Footer />` and a `<Header/>`
- Add a `<ActionBanner />` just after the `<Header />`
- Wrap every pages that is not a `template` inside a `<Container />` component. It will add margins and add some responsive behavior to it.
- Add whatever you want inside `<Container />`!

## Quick example

Here is a snippet you can use to kickstart any project !

```javascript
import {
  ThemeProvider,
  Container,
  Header,
